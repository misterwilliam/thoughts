# Morals

Morals are people’s (strongly felt) opinions about the best way to organize
society. By this I mean that morals are not objective truths that are part of
the nature of the universe. They are just opinions. However they are strongly
felt opinions. And because they are strongly felt opinions on the best way to
organize society, we all feel extremely vested in whether other people do or
don't follow our morals.

This idea may seem unusual so let me introduce this philosophy by stating some
ideas that may distinguish it from moral philosophies that you may be familiar
with.

**Morals are emotional.** The dividing line between moral and non-moral opinions
on how to organize society is how strongly people (emotionally) feel about the
topic. If the distinction between a presidential and parliamentary democracy is
something that you feel strongly about, it is a moral topic for you. Otherwise
it is just a preference. Therefore the distinction is arbitrary. On the other
hand, the reason people get so upset when they see their moral framework
violated is because they feel upset about the anticipated outcomes. If we had
followed their moral code, we would have gotten what they perceive as the best
possible outcomes according to their moral code. Instead we are getting
suboptimal outcomes. How much worse these outcomes are perceived to be decides
how upset the person will be. This moral outrage is why morals feel so weighty.
We want other people to adopt our moral framework, and we feel (emotionally)
quite strongly about this.

**Morals are complicated and unknown.** Morality is the topic of how to organize
society and unfortunately that topic is too vast for anyone to claim to have all
the answers. All we have are people’s best guesses, therefore nobody can
justifiable claim moral authority. Nobody really knows the best way to organize
society. Nobody has all the answers to moral questions. This is important to
keep in mind when considering any moral disagreement. The underlying topic is
complicated and nobody has all the answers on the base assumptions.

**Morals are pragmatic, situational and outcome oriented.** The best way to do
anything depends on the consequences. The consequences depend on the situation.
The situation dictates the possible options. The options have tradeoffs.

**Morals are a societal project.** While the best way to organize society is too
complicated for any one person to discover. We still need to function as a
society. The most practical solution is to seek a shared collective answer.

**Morals can be a civil discussion topic even when people disagree.** This is
probably a familiar goal. However I believe my framing helps give a perspective
on how to manage our own emotions and approach the topic in a civil way. Nobody
knows what the best way to organize society is. The topic is just too
complicated. However it is a topic everyone feels strongly about. So we should
recognize that we and others may get too caught up in the emotions.

## 5 Moral Considerations

If we say that morals are just opinions, it can cause morals to lose their
grounding. Opinions have an arbitrary nature. Why should we consider one
person's opinion better than another's? However if we specify that morals are
opinions on the best way to organize society, this gives these opinions a lot
more grounding. It seems much more obvious that we can evaluate these opinions
because that is instinctively what we all do.

I categorize all the arguments we instinctively reach for when evaluating any
moral rule into 5 categories. I like this category system because I feel that
each category represents a desirable trait, and it is fairly simple for the most
part to understand why each trait is desirable without getting into complex
philosophical arguments.

1. Alignment with reality

Every moral framework implicitly has assumptions on the underlying nature of
reality. This could be that there is a god or that there is not a god. It could
be that assumption is capitalism is an efficient means of deciding the
distribution of goods. It could be that that emotional experiences have primacy
over the physical reality. It could be that morals are an objective fact and
part of the nature of the universe.

A successful method of organizing society needs to be aligned with reality.
Describing the underlying assumed reality of a moral framework may not be a
primary consideration but it is a necessary consideration. When a moral
framework is not tied to some theory on the nature of reality it is unclear what
motivates its moral rules.

The underlying assumptions of a method to organize society can deviate from
reality and still remain successful to a degree. All moral systems will have
some misalignments with reality when expressed in a detailed enough manner to be
applied in all the situations of life. We should not view alignment with reality
as a binary category. The nature of the deviation from reality and how
devastating it is to a coherent interpretation of the moral system is the
relevant discussion.

For example, I include the true nature of how economies function within the
category of "alignment with reality". In modern political discourse there are
strongly felt discussions on how to organize society that rely on assumptions on
how the economy truly functions. This would be an example where it makes sense
to evaluate how much the assumptions deviate from reality, and how much it
undermines the moral framework.

2. Maximizing welfare and minimizing suffering

Methods of organizing society are implicitly designed to achieve positive
outcomes. The precise nature of what is positive outcome, what is suffering,
what is maximal welfare are not concepts where there is a universal shared
consensus. So defining these terms are part of a moral framework as well as
describing how to achieve the optimization of those factors.

3. Fair exchange

It is not sufficient to just consider collective welfare. It is also necessary
to consider fairness when people interact with each other. Once again what is
fair is not a concept with a shared universal understanding. How the concept of
fairness is defined is a key consideration as well as describing how to achieve
fair interactions between people.

4. Respecting individual will

People may accept that there is a broader collective good, but at the same time
they still desire independence. I view this as a consequence of human nature. If
human's did not care about their individuality and behaved more like ants there
would be no need to consider individuality.

5. An explanation for why we should value one another

This consideration adds social cohesion to any moral framework. Without this
consideration social structures are inherently fragile because the rationale for
not harming one another becomes weak.

Iit is an essential consideration because without this consideration all human
interaction risks be understood in transactional means. Even if we take
consideration 4 (respect of individuality), we can treat one another
transactionally. Without an explanation why we should value one another, then it
is unclear why we should not destroy one another. One might think that valuing
one another would be a logical consequence of requirement 4 (respecting
individual will) combines with other requirements such as 2 (maximizing welfare
and minimizing suffering), however Western liberal capitalism highly values
individuality and has empirically be shown to be quite effective at maximizing
welfare and minimizing suffering when compared to social structures which have
been deployed at scale in practice, and yet has no explanation for why we should
value one another.

If we summarize Western liberalism as a philosophy granting all humans the
rights to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”, and capitalism which
manifests an invisible hand that guides welfare maximization, we have no
explanation for why we should value one another. Under this philosophy it
becomes unclear why society should subsidize the welfare of economically
unproductive individuals such as the mentally unstable beyond allowing for them
to live, and the liberty to pursue opioid addiction.

It is because that Western liberal capitalism argues strongly for categories
1–4, but offers no argument for why we should value one another that I view it
as a separate category.

## Why these categories

One one hand, these categories are merely categories, and if you would prefer to
organize moral arguments by with different category system that does not
contradict what I am proposing. One the other hand, I have stated that each
category represents a desirable trait for any moral framework. Therefore if
someone where to claim that these desirable traits were not desirable or just
merely marginally relevant to moral discussions that would represent a challenge
to my argument. Therefore it would make sense for me to argue that each category
is indeed a desirable trait.

While I do feel that I can argue for each category being desirable, I do also
feel that they are largely self-evident. Therefore I am happy enough to just
treat them as assumptions, and if you feel that any category does not represent
a desirable trait then we just fundamentally have different perspectives and I
am not sure what I can say to persuade you.

On the other hand, there is a context in which I would be interested in arguing
that these categories genuinely represent desirable traits and not merely just
assumptions. If we consider a future hyper-intelligent AI that it seems that we
are on the path to building, I am interested in the question of whether we
should expect that this AI would consider my 5 categories as representing
desirable traits. If we should expect the hyper-intelligent future AI to view
these categories as desirable traits then we can feel confident that these
future AIs will view moral issues in a similar way that we do at least at a
fundamental level. That deserves it's own essay which unfortunately I have not
yet written.

Also my 5 categories are somewhat described in a human centric way. To keep the
description simpler I have written everything as humans were the only conscious
entity. I do think that they should be extended to apply to any conscious
entity. So they should be extended to apply to animals, aliens (if they exist),
and conscious AI agents if we ever build them.

## Whether morals are objective or subjective makes no difference in practice

Morals are subjective not objective but it hardly makes a difference Because I
have defined morals as people’s opinions, that means that morals are no longer
an objective facts about the universe. They are now subjective. However since I
have defined morals as opinions about the best way to organize society, and
shown that certain considerations naturally arise when trying to design the best
way to organize society, it hardly seems to matter whether morals are objective
or subjective. When trying to decide what your morals should be, these
considerations will cause you to select the more or less the same moral rules
you would have chosen if you thought at morals were objective.

## The societal project

The 5 considerations that I have presented do not clearly define a particular
moral perspective because they (purposefully) rely on several concepts which do
not have a clear definition. What is the nature of reality? What is the nature
of welfare and suffering? What is fairness? How should we balance allowing for
individuality versus other considerations? Why should we value each other? These
are the core questions that we collectively need to answer.
