# Morals

Morals are people’s (strongly felt) opinions about the best way to organize
society. By this I mean that morals are not objective truths that are part of
the nature of the universe. They are just opinions. However they are strongly
felt opinions. And because they are strongly felt opinions on the best way to
organize society, we all feel extremely vested in whether other people do or
don't follow our morals.

This idea may seem unusal so let me introduce this philosophy by stating some
ideas that may distinguish it from moral philosophies that you maybe familiar
with.

**Morals are emotional.** The dividing line between moral and non-moral opinions
on how to organize society is how strongly people (emotionally) feel about the
topic. If the distinction between a presidential and parliamentary democracy is
something that you feel strongly about, it is a moral topic for you. Otherwise
it is just a preference. Therefore the distinction is arbitrary. On the other
hand, the reason people get so upset when they see their moral framework
violated is because they feel upset about the anticipated outcomes. If we had
followed their moral code, we would have gotten what they perceive as the best
possible outcomes according to their moral code. Instead we are getting
suboptimal outcomes. How much worse these outcomes are perceived to be decides
how upset the person will be. This moral outrage is why morals feel so weighty.
We want other people to adopt our moral framework, and we feel (emotionally)
quite strongly about this.

**Morals are complicated and unknown.** Morality is the topic of how to organize
society and unfortunately that topic is too vast for anyone to claim to have all
the answers. All we have are people’s best guesses, therefore nobody can
justifiable claim moral authority. Nobody really knows the best way to organize
society. Nobody has all the answers to moral questions. This is important to
keep in mind when considering any moral disagreement. The underlying topic is
complicated and nobody has all the answers on the base assumptions.

**Morals are pragmatic, situational and outcome oriented.** The best way to do
anything depends on the consequences. The consequences depend on the situation.
The situation dictates the possible options. The options have tradeoffs.

**Morals are a societal project.** While the best way to organize society is too
complicated for any one person to discover. We still need to function as a
society. The most practical solution is to try come to come to a shared
collective answer.

**Morals can be a civil discussion topic even when people disagree.** This is
probably a familiar goal. However I believe my framing helps give a perspective
on how to manage our own emotions and approach the topic in a civil way. Nobody
knows what the best way to organize society is. The topic is just too
complicated. However it is a topic everyone feels strongly about. So we should
recognize that we and others may get too caught up in the emotions.

## 5 Moral Considerations

1. Alignment with reality

Every moral framework implicitly has assumptions on the underlying nature of
reality. This could be that there is a god or that there is not a god. It could
be that assumption is capitalism is an efficient means of deciding the
distribution of goods. It could be that that emotional experience has primacy
over the physical reality. A successful method of organizing society needs to be
aligned with reality. Describing the underlying assumed reality of a moral
framework may not be a primary consideration but it is a necessary
consideration. When a moral framework is not tied to some theory on the nature
of reality it tends to become unclear what motivates its moral rules.

2. Maximizing welfare and minimizing suffering

Methods of organizing society are implicitly designed to achieve positive
outcomes. The precise nature of what is positive outcome, what is suffering,
what is maximal welfare are not concepts where there is a universal shared
consensus. So defining these terms are part of a moral framework as well as
describing how to achieve the optimization of those factors.

3. Fair exchange

Become a member It is not sufficient to just consider collective welfare. It is
also necessary to consider fairness when people interact with each other. Once
again what is fair is not a concept with a shared universal understanding. How
the concept of fairness is defined is a key consideration as well as describing
how to achieve fair interactions between people.

4. Respecting individual will

People may accept that there is a broader collective good, but at the same time
they still desire independence. How the social structure allows for individual
will while maintaining the other considerations is a key question when
evaluating any moral framework.

5. An explanation for why we should value one another

This consideration adds social cohesion to any moral framework. Without this
consideration social structures are inherently fragile because the rationale for
not harming one another becomes weak. This consideration is the most under
appreciated in modern discourse.

The 5 considerations that I have presented do not clearly define a particular
moral perspective because they (purposefully) rely on several concepts which do
not have a clear definition. What is the nature of reality? What is the nature
of welfare and suffering? What is fairness? How should we balance allowing for
individuality versus other considerations? Why should we value each other? These
are the core questions that we collectively need to answer.

The considerations that I selected may seem like an arbitrary hodgepodge but
there is a rationale for their selection. Morality is about how to organize
society. How we organize society is of critical importance because as an
organized collective, people can achieve significantly better outcomes than
relying on ad-hoc interactions. Therefore moral frameworks are in competition
with one another in demonstrating their capability of achieving positive
outcomes. Considerations 1 and 2 (alignment with reality, and maximizing welfare
and minimizing suffering) are fairly straightforward considerations that arise
more or less directly from the definition of attempting to construct a system
that achieves good outcomes. Consideration 3 (fair exchange), logically arises
from the reality that no one can be certain of being in a position of dominance
in the future, and especially also not all of their loved ones. No matter how
powerful one is, they will want some guarantee that in the future as their
health declines they will be treated with fairness, as well as their offspring
which presumably are their loved ones. Consideration 4 (respecting individual
will) is the logical consequence of human nature. No matter how self-sacrificing
an individual is, everyone wants their individual will respected. The mere
recognition of the concept of self-sacrifice betrays the innate desire for
individuality. Consideration 5 (an explanation for why we should value one
another) deserves it’s own discussion.

Out of all the considerations, consideration 5 may seem the most out of the
place however it is an essential consideration because without this
consideration all human interaction risks be understood in transactional means.
Even if we take consideration 4 (respect of individuality), we can treat one
another transactionally. Without an explanation why we should value one another,
then it is unclear why we should not destroy one another. One might think that
valuing one another would be a logical consequence of requirement 4 (respecting
individual will) combines with other requirements such as 2 (maximizing welfare
and minimizing suffering), however Western liberal capitalism highly values
individuality and has empirically be shown to be quite effective at maximizing
welfare and minimizing suffering when compared to social structures which have
been deployed at scale in practice, and yet has no explanation for why we should
value one another.

If we summarize Western liberalism as a philosophy granting all humans the
rights to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”, and capitalism which
manifests an invisible hand that guides welfare maximization, we have no
explanation for why we should value one another. Under this philosophy it
becomes unclear why society should subsidize the welfare of economically
unproductive individuals such as the mentally unstable beyond allowing for them
to live, and the liberty to pursue opioid addiction.

It is because that Western liberal capitalism argues strongly for my
requirements 1–4, but offers no argument for 5 (why we should value one another)
that I view it as a separate requirement.

Morals are subjective not objective but it hardly makes a difference Because I
have defined morals as people’s opinions, that means that morals are no longer
an objective facts about the universe. They are now subjective. However since I
have defined morals as opinions about the best way to organize society, and
shown that certain considerations naturally arise when trying to design the best
way to organize society, it hardly seems to matter whether morals are objective
or subjective. When trying to decide what your morals should be, these
considerations will cause you to select the more or less the same moral rules
you would have chosen if you thought at morals were objective.
